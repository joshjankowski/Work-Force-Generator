## [Work Force Generator

This project can be used to create cards for employees such as Engineers, Managers, Interns and regular Employees to show specific information.

The user can select the job family and then will be prompted through multiple questions. Once those questions are answered, the generator will create a html page with all content.

## Motivation

I created this project to illustrate my skillset utilizing node, object oriented javascript, css and html.
